# JAVA-ISC
These are the projects I did during my time at school while I learnt JAVA language. All of these programs are in written in Java, I had a great teacher who was very cheerful and I miss her a lot....
These are mostly the programs that print specific patters, matrices, that sort, do funny things with strings and arrays, while some prgrams are that of calculating telephone bill, arithmetic, hadamard matrix, special numbers like armstrong,Adam's number, etc
These programs were done in BlueJ, which was the editor adn compiler that we used to learn JAVA in highschool.
All of the programs are finished and compile error free and provide an output, while few(just maybe one or two) are unfinished and they need few changes.
