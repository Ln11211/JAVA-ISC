# JAVA-ISC
These are the projects I did during my time at school while I learnt JAVA language. All of these programs are written in Java, I had a great teacher who was very cheerful and I miss her a lot....
These are mostly the programs that print specific patters, matrices, that sort, do funny things with strings and arrays, while some programs are that of calculating telephone bill, arithmetic, hadamard matrix, special numbers like armstrong,Adam's number,prime pallindrome etc
These programs were done in BlueJ, which was the editor and the compiler that we used to learn JAVA in highschool.
All the programs are finished and compile error free and provide an output, while few(just maybe one or two) are unfinished and they need few changes.
